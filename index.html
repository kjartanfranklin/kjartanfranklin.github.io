								<p>My name is Kjartan Franklín Magnús and I am an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Iceland. Here I want to tell you about a few factors that define my character and personality. One of my biggest personality traits is that I have a strong need for creativity. I always seek for some creativity in all my projects and in life in general, such as composing a piece on the piano, making videos and much more. Another important thing to know about me is that when I find a subject that I really like I go all in and dive deep into it. I am a very loyal individual and I like to think of myself as a leader. If you want to learn more about me I suggest you take a look at my <a href="#resume">resume</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">How to make a website</h2>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/web.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p><b>Project description</b> <br> The goal of this project was to make a website using HTLM and then to upload it to Github so it could be accessed through any browser. The website will be used throughout the remainder of this course to hand in and store assignments. The website also has the potential to be useful after I graduate, e.g. when I apply for a post-graduate education or apply for a job.</p>
                                <p><b>First things first</b><br>To make a website using HTML you'll need the right software to get the job done. So the first thing I did was setting up <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> so I could write the HTML script and test the result. One feature that I really liked, and used a lot, was the live view button. When you press the live view button (as demonstrated below) you can see how your website is coming along.  </p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/live.gif" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I had never before worked with HTML so it wasn't realistic to write the whole script on my own. I needed some help so I browsed through templates made by <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a>. I really enjoyed the minimalistic features of the template called Dimensions so I downloaded it, which is free when it's not used for business related matters. At this point I was all set up to make the look of my very own website.</p>
                                <p><b>The script</b> <br> First I opened up the template by HTML5 UP in Brackets. I was able to change the text where I wanted to but when I wanted to change the format and style I needed to gather additional information. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a> came in really handy for learning more about HTML. With their help I found out how to change images, text styles, how to insert linkes and much more! <br> It was also important to read the script that came with the template and try to understand what was going on. When you understand the script you can use it to your advantage. I also looked at the websites of two former students for inspiration, but I tried to make the website as much my own as I could. The image below demonstrates how w3schools.com helped me to align the image on the home page so it would fit into the circle.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/w3.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p><b>Uploading to Github</b><br> I already had a Github account but if you don't have one you can create it <a href="https://github.com">here</a>. The next step was to make a new repository, have in mind that the name of the repository will be the name of the website. Next I scoured the Internet for information on how to upload my website to my repository on Github. I spent a few hours trying to figure it out and asked my fellow classmates for help but there seemed to be a problem going on nobody quite understood. Down below you can see one of the errors I delt with.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/error.png" alt="" /></span>    
                                <p>After many trials and errors on the Terminal application on my MacBook I think a found the simplest way of uploading the website into my repository. Here it is step by step:</p>
                                <p>1. Open up your repository.</p>
                                <p>2. Select add file.</p>
                                <p>3. Select upload files.</p>
                                <p>4. Choose your files or drag them into the box.</p>
                                <p>5. Wait for the files to load.</p>
                                <p>6. Press Commit changes.</p>
                                <p>That's it! After that I was able to go to kjartanfranklin.github.io in my browser and enjoy my new website.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/upload.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>To be fair, I am unforunately not entirely sure if some of the things I did in the Terminal application made this process possible.</p>
                                <p><b>Looking back</b> <br> As I said in the column <a href="#about">About me</a> I really enjoy projects where there is room for creativity, so I really enjoyed this project. I have often wondered about website design and development and wanted to learn more about it. Now I have some basic knowledge on how to make a website using HTML and I certainly appreciate it.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Press fit laser cut</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nespresso.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                            <p><b>Project description</b> <br> The goal of this project was to make a press fit model, with parameters, of a building unit. The model has to be scaleble so it's possible to adjust kerf, thickness, sizes of the surfaces, by working with parametric variables.</p>
                            <p><b>Idea</b> <br> I got a new Nespresso machine this christmas and I'm currently working on making a nice Nespresso station. I had already bought a tray and coffee mugs but I still needed an object to store all the Nespresso capsules. When I read the project description I immediately decided I was going to make something that I needed and was able to get some use out of. With that said I thougt it would be perfect for me to build a unit that stores Nespresso capsules. I also decided to add another compartment to the unit for used capsuled so I don't have to make a trip upstaires to the recycling bag everytime I use a capsule. I thought it would be best to design a slider to remove the compartment for the used capsules.</p>
                            <p><b>Design</b> <br>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/Fusion.png" alt="" /></span> 
                            <p> For the design I used Fusion 360, you can download the application <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360">here</a>. I was already familiar with other CAD programs like AutoCad Inventor, so I knew I would be able to make the design in Fusion without to many problems. On the image above you can see how the design looks in Fusion 360. Hafliði, our instructor, linked a YouTube video on how to make finger joints in Fusion 360 wich you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE&ab_channel=HobbyistMaker">here</a>. This video helped me out a lot and it also shows how to work with parameters. Parameters are essential if you want to be able to adjust the size of your design with out much trouble. On the image below you can see my parameters in this project.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/Parametrar.png" alt="" /></span> 
                            <p><b>Adjusting for kerf</b> <br> Before I had finished my design I went to the Fablab in Breiðholt to take a look at the laser cutting machine with my group. We needed to find out the kerf of the laser so we could adjust our design to the widht of the laser. Kerf is a word used to describe the thickness that the laser cuts off from the surface of the object. The finger joints of the object would not be press fit without adjusting for kerf. You can read all about how to measure kerf <a href="https://mundi55.github.io/gudmundurfr/kerf.html">here</a>. <br> When we had measured the kerf I installed a plug in for Fusion 360 called DXF for Laser, you can find it <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=7634902334100976871&os=Win64&appLang=en">here</a>. DXF for laser is super easy to use. You can follow these steps to adjust the surfaces of your object for kerf and save them as a DXF file using DXF for laser: 
                            <br>
                            <br> 1. In Fusion 360 click on create and select "Save DXF for Laser Cutting" from the drop down menu.
                            <br> 2. Select the face of the surface you want to adjust for kerf.
                            <br> 3. Type in the kerf you measured and press "ok".
                            <br> 4. Save the .dxf file in the folder of your choosing.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/dxf.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p><b>Getting ready for laser cutting</b> <br> For the next part you will need to download an application called Inkscape. You can find it <a href="https://inkscape.org/">here</a> it's free!. Once you've set up Inkscape open up a new file. It's important that you have the page the same size as the material you are cutting from. In my case it was 300x600mm. To change the page size go to File-Document Properties and from there it should be self explanatory. <br>
                            Now you can open up all the dxf files you saved in the previous step and distribute them so that they all fit on the page. Next you will have to change the line thickness. In my case the laser cutter cuts out all lines with 0,02 mm thickness. To change this I opened the Fill and Stroke menu, made sure there was no fill and changed the widht in the Stroke style colomn. All other lines or shapes that are not 0,02mm are rastered on the material you are using. <br> I wanted to raster a image on each side of my object to make it look cooler. The way I did it was to find a simple png image online and import it to Inkscape. I had to be able to control the fill and stroke. To do this you have to have the image as an object. Select Path and from the dropdown menu select Trace bitmap. This will not work for complex images. Next I opened up the Fill and Stroke menu, removed the stroke and had only fill. The only thing left to do is to save the Inkscape file as a pdf document. The image below shows my Inkscape document with the Fill and Stroke menu opened. </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/ink.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p><b>Laser cutting</b></p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/haflidi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>Once you have your pdf file you are ready to use the laser printer. To cut out your object using a laser cutter follows the same steps as cutting out the kerf test so I'll let it suffice to refer to the kerf test documentation which you can find <a href="https://mundi55.github.io/gudmundurfr/kerf.html">here</a>. After cutting out the object all that is left is to put the pieces together. If your object is press fit like mine you will probably have to use some sort of hammer to get the finger joints together (I used a rubber maller), but be carefull not to brake the finger joints. <br> Thank you for reading about this project and if you decided to follow this process then congratulations on your brand new Nespresso capsule container! Down below you can see a short gif of the design coming to life.</p>

                        <!-- 3D printing constraints -->
                            <article id="constraints">
                                <h2 class="major">3D printing constraints</h2>
                                <p><b>Guðmundur Freyr, Gyrðir Hrafn and Kjartan Franklin</b></p>
                                <p>Before 3D printing an object with a 3D printer it is important to know the constraints of the 3D printer. The most important constraint we look for is at what angle degree the printer starts "failing" with out support. This is important for us to know so we can adjust the support of our model before 3D printing. <br> Our instructor, Hafliði, allowed us to use the same model that another group had already made. The only thing we had to do was to set it up in Ultimaker Cura which is a free 3D printing software that you can find <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura">here</a>.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/3dtest2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>The image above showes the settings we used in Cura. We had never before worked with the software so we relied on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-hvXZgH76o&ab_channel=Technivorous3dprinting">this video</a>, to get all the information on how the most important settings work. As you can see on the image above we used a layer height of 0.2 with 20% infill. We had no support for obvious reasons and no adhesion. <br> The next thing to do is to press "Slice" in cura. The image below shows the outcome. </p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/3dtest1.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>After that our model was ready for 3D printing. It is important that you select the right printer in Cura, in our case we worked with Ultimaker3 Extended. Then we saved the file from cura to a USB drive, plugged it in to the printer and started the 3D printing process.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Ultimaker.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Ultimaker2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>When the printer had finished its job it was time to take a look at the result. As you can see on the images below the printer started "failing" at around 60 degrees. So we knew that for our individual models the support settings should be: Everything over 60 degrees should have support.</p>

                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/kaffi2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p><b>Design</b> <br> I desided to design the object with Fusion 360, which you can find <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360">here</a>. I already had some experience with the application in the previous project. I found a YouTube video that helped me with the design in Fusion, but I made a lot of alterations. You can find the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTDkej-hx1g&ab_channel=ProCAD4U">here</a>. You can see how the final design looked in Fusion down below.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/fusion_bolli.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I worked with parameters so that I could make alterations with out to much trouble. You can see the parameters I used in this project below.</p>

                                <p><b>Constraints</b> <br> Before you can 3D print an object you need to find out the constraints of the 3D printer. You can read all about how me and my group found out the constraints here. </p>
